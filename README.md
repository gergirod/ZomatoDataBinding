# ZomatoDataBinding

### Simple app that show a list of the top 10 Restaurants in Melbourne

Build with __Kotlin__, applying **SOLID** principles and using the **Clean Architecture** approach.
I also implement the **Model View ViewModel** design pattern, which abstracts the user interactions from the business logic. Additionally, I used **coroutines** for Asynchronous tasks, **Retrofit** to get data from https://developers.zomato.com/api api,**DataBinding** to bind UI components in the layouts to data sources using a declarative format rather than programmatically, **Glide** library for image loading and **Dagger2** for dependency injection.
